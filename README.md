# Python-order-plugin
This mini-project was the part of my exam task in IT STEP Academy ("Basics of Python" part).

Program is checking for data from file "ORDER.TXT" that you enter in console by "input" commands. You're able to order 3 types of pizza from menu which is written
in "MENU.txt".

Quick guide to launch it:
  1. Firstly, download all files in the same folder.
  2. Secondly, check the paths for "ORDER.txt" and "MENU.txt" written in the Python code.
  3. Launch it in any IDE.
